# P1 - Coverage Report

## Overview

Overall, we did a fantastic job at maximizing the use the of the test suite. We have near 100% coverage on all of our code.
We were a little late to learn and utilize jacoco during this project, but now that we are familiar with it and see how useful it can be,
we are excited to utilize it more going forward.
