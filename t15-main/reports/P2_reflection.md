# P2 Reflection

### What went well

- Team did well in terms of communication and collaboration
- Team was able to meet the project requirements
- Team was able to retroactively implement the project requirements of P1 that were not working properly
- We had very little merge conflicts
- Able to meet weekly, and discuss progress and issues

### What was challenging

- We had to re-implement the project requirements of P1 that were not working properly
- We had issues delegating tasks due to the nature of the assignment, a lot of methods were dependent on each other, so it was hard to split up

### What we would do differently

- Start a little bit sooner, 
- Have a better understanding of the project requirements before starting
