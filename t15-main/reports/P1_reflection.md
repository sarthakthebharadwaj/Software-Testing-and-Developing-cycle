This sprint highlighted both successes and areas for improvement in our team's collaboration. A significant positive aspect was maintaining consistent weekly meetings, which facilitated regular check-ins and progress assessments. Additionally, the team made a thorough effort to support one another, demonstrating a sense of teamwork and mutual assistance throughout the sprint’s duration.

However, several challenges also emerged. A key issue was the team's delay in initiating the project work, resulting in an overwhelming amount of tasks to complete as the deadline approached. This highlighted the importance of early progress with project tasks to distribute workload more evenly over time. Furthermore, the team encountered communication difficulties with Microsoft Teams, which sometimes hindered efficient collaboration. Another notable problem was the lack of early examination of the dependencies among different methods required for the classes. This oversight led to delays, as progress on certain tasks was contingent upon the completion of others, highlighting a critical area for process improvement.

For future sprints, the team has identified several actionable changes to increase performance and outcomes. Transitioning from Teams to Discord is proposed as a solution to improve communication due to a team member’s access restriction from her employer. Starting the project earlier is another change aimed at avoiding the last minute rush and ensuring a more balanced distribution of work. Additionally, we will use the first meeting of the sprint to figure out a strategic approach for the sprint, involving a thorough analysis of method and class dependencies. By understanding these dependencies upfront, we can assign tasks more effectively to minimize delays. Lastly, optimizing the use of meeting times by focusing on developing a well-thought-out implementation approach is suggested to increase productivity. These adjustments should address the shortcomings experienced in this sprint and will help the team for greater success in the future.
